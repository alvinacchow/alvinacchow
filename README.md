### Personal details: 

Some hobbies of mine include baking and cooking 🍜 , playing sports such as volleyball 🏐 and bowling 🎳, and watching athletic events, especially the Golden State Warriors 💙💛! I dream of opening a bakery as a side business, where I would sell a mix of Asian and French pastries and baked goods. My favorite travel destinations so far have been Hong Kong and Japan, and I wish to travel to France, England, and Thailand in the future ✈️. A fun fact of mine is that I speak three languages: English, Cantonese, and Mandarin.
