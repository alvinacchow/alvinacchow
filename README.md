## Welcome! It's nice to see you 👋

I am a first-year student at the University of California, Irvine, majoring in Software Engineering and minoring in Innovation and Entrepreneurship! I hope to work as a product manager in the tech industry, right at the intersection of business and tech. I am using this github as a platform to track my personal progress in developing cool software!

### Personal details: 

Some hobbies of mine include baking and cooking 🍜 , playing sports such as volleyball 🏐 and basketball 🏀, and watching athletic events, especially my Golden State Warriors 💙💛! I dream of opening a bakery as a side business, where I would sell a mix of Asian and French pastries and baked goods. My favorite travel destinations so far have been Hong Kong and Japan, and I wish to travel to France, England, and Thailand in the future ✈️. A fun fact of mine is that I speak three languages: English, Cantonese, and Mandarin.
